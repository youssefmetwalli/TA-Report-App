We have decided to use flutter/dart for the front-end of our application.
Our back-end operates using node.js, mysql stores our database.

To build and test our app, please simply:
1. navigate to the front-end folder via terminal
2. run our app using 'flutter run' command


Common problems you might face during running/building the application:
-You can find out whether you are lacking any necessities/ or are facing any problems by running command 'flutter doctor'.
-If your build isn't running smoothly as expected, please try deleting the 'pubspec.lock' file then running command 'flutter pub get'.
-command 'flutter clean' can optionally be executed (before executing 'flutter pub get') to make sure the app builds smoothly.
